# Beehive Tooltips

> A Minecraft 1.16.x data pack that adds tooltips to beehives and bee nests.

## Installation

Download the latest release from [here][latest] and put the datapack zip file into the `datapacks` folder of your Minecraft world. Download the resourcepack zip file (if available) and enable the pack in your client.

I usually provide resourcepacks to allow translations of my datapacks :)

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the datapack, run the `zerotask:beehive_tooltips/uninstall` function and remove the datapack from your world save. Afterwards, run `reload`.

## License

The data pack is licensed under the GPLv3. For more information, take a look at the license file within this repository.

## Inspiration

This datapack is inspired by [BeehiveTooltips][mod], a Minecraft [Fabric][fabric] mod.
